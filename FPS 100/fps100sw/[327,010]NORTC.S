"
"    --- ABSTRACT ---
"  PLACES A NEW TASK ON THE CLOCK QUEUE.  IN DOING SO, IT COMPUTES THE
"  CORRECT DELTA TIME FACTOR FOR THE TASK AN INSERTS IT IN A TIME
"  PRIORITY POSITION IN THE QUEUE.  IF IT IS INSERTED INTO THE HEAD OF THE
"  QUEUE, IT CALLS RESTAR TO RESTART THE RTC WITH THE NEW TIMEOUT VALUE.
"
"  BUT FOR THIS VERSION THIS ROUTINE JUST RETURNS !
"  THE PARAMETERS FOR CALLING ADDCLK ARE:
"       DPX(0) = THE REQUESTED TIME TO WAIT
"       DPX(1) = THE NEW TASK'S TCB
"

"
"     --- ABSTRACT ---
"  REMOVES A TASK FROM THE CLOCK QUEUE.  THE QUEUE'S DELTA FACTORS ARE
"  FIXED UP AND IF THE TASK WAS AT THE HEAD OF THE QUEUE, RESTAR IS
"  CALLED TO RESTART THE RTC WITH THE NEXT TASK IN THE QUEUE.
"
"  BUT FOR THIS VERSION, IT JUST DOES A RETURN !
"
"  THE PARAMETER FOR CALLING RMVCLK IS:
"       DPX(1) = THE TASK'S TCB ADDRESS
"
