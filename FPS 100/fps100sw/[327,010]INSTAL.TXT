 2  DESCRIPTION OF DISTRIBUTION MATERIALS
+   _____________________________________
   2.1  The Tape.
+       _________
     Software for the FPS100 is delivered on a 9-track tape, which contains  all
     software  pertaining  to  it  that  is  supplied  by FPS.  The tape must be
     written with Parity off (= 0) and the last  record  per  file  padded  with
     blank lines.  Density may be either 800 or 1600 BPI.
     The specific contents are listed in the  index  accompanying  the  magnetic
     tape.   The  index  is shipped both on paper, and as files two and three on
     the tape.  The "short" index lists the filenames as they appear in order on
     the tape, and the "long" index gives  more  detailed  information  on  each
     file.
     The first file on the tape (file 0) is the MAGTAP utility program used  for
     reading  the  tape.  This file is written with a blocking factor of one and
     is read by the KEYTAP program which is entered, compiled,  task  built  and
     run from the operator's console.  The remainder of the tape is written with
     a  blocking factor that is specified on the tape label.  The second file is
     the names files and contains the names of all the files  as  they  will  be
     written  to  disk,  along  with  "pass numbers" to facilitate the automatic
     installation.  This file is used by MAGTAP in reading the rest of the tape.
   2.2  The Documentation.
+       __________________
     The installation documentation package consists of:
     a) These instructions.
     b) The short index of the tape.
     c) The long index of the tape.
     d) A printout of the number of records and blocks for each file.

 3  SYSTEM INITIALIZATION
+   _____________________
   3.1  System Setup.
+       _____________
     The installer  must  be  able  to  use  a  privileged  terminal   for   the
     installation.
     3.1.1 Special System Configurations
       Two RK05's - This installation procedure is  based  upon  the  assumption
       that  the  equivalent  of  two RK05 disk drives are available.  One drive
       should have the system disk with FORTRAN, System Libraries, Task Builder,
       Librarian, Editor, and Utility routines.  The other drive  will  be  used
       for the work disk.
       Two RL01's -  Proceed  as  for  two  RK05's,  substitute  "DL"  for  "DK"
       throughout.
       Large Disks - Do "PIP /FR" to verify that there is indeed a large  amount
       of  disk space available, then proceed to "Reading the Tape".  Use "DP0:"
       or whatever for "DK0:"  and "DK1:"  throughout.
       FORTRAN-IV-PLUS - Substitute "F4P" for "FOR" throughout these notes.
     3.1.2 Generating a Copy of the Customer's System Disk
       This is accomplished by mounting a system disk on drive 0 and  a  scratch
       disk  which  will become the installation system disk on drive one.  Then
       the following  procedure  will  copy  the  site  system   disk   to   the
       installation system disk.
            INS $BAD         ! May not be necessary.
            SET /NOPUB=DK1:  ! May not be necessary.
            ALL DK1:         ! May not be necessary.
            BAD DK1:
            BOO LB:[1,51]DSCS8
            DK1:=DK0:
            ** If that sequence gives error messages, try:
            INS $BAD         ! May not be necessary.
            SET /NOPUB=DK1:  ! May not be necessary.
            ALL DK1:         ! May not be necessary.
            BAD DK1:

       **************************************************
     3.1.3 Stripping the System Disk to the Minimum
       Make yourself  completely  privileged,  unprotect  all  files,  and   get
       everything down to one version apiece:
            SET /UIC=[1,1]
            INS $PIP         ! May not be necessary.

       Then type "PIP [*,*]*.*;*/SD".  The system will then ask, one-by-one  for
       every  file  there is, whether that file should be deleted.  Type a Y for
       any file that is not in the following list:

     that DK1:  was assigned to SY:  at the beginning  of  this  section.   This
     means  that the MAGTAP routine will put the command files on disk 1.  For a
     detailed discussion of the MAGTAP program, see section VII.
     When possible, command files should be run on a hard copy terminal.  If  on
     a  soft  copy  terminal,  someone  should  watch for error messages.  It is
     possible that an error could occur which would not stop  the  command  file
     but would make the software incorrect.

 4  THE INSTALLATION PROCESS
+   ________________________
   4.1 Introduction
     4.1.1  Command Files
+           _____________
       The RSX11M Indirect Command File processor is  used  extensively  in  the
       installation  of FPS software.  Basically, this is a facility that allows
       execution of command lines directly from a file.  The principal knowledge
       required for using command files is how to  invoke  them;   the  rest  is
       automatic  or  self-explanatory.   There  are 27 command files associated
       with this installation.  The structure of the command files  is  detailed
       in the next section.
       Some additional knowledge may be helpful in running these command  files.
       The way to invoke a command file and begin its execution is:
           @FILENAME    (where FILENAME.CMD is the command file)
       The .CMD extension is assumed by the processor so it is not required.
       Typing a CTRL-Z will terminate a command file that is asking for terminal
       input.  This will close all files and cause a clean exit.  Such an action
       may be  used  if  you  notice  that  a  previous  question  was  answered
       incorrectly.
       Typing a CTRL-C will suspend a command file that  is  executing  and  not
       asking  for  terminal input.  This stops execution and allows the user to
       communicate with the MCR (Monitor Console Routine) in order  to  enter  a
       system  command.   To  terminate  the command file, type the following in
       response to the prompt "MCR>":
           ABO AT.
       which aborts the indirect command file  processor.   If  it  was  in  the
       process  of  executing  an MCR command or program (such as MAC, PIP, TKB,
       etc.), that program will continue to completion even though  the  command
       file was stopped.  The program may be aborted by typing:
           ABO MAC    (or whatever program is executing)
       Realize that an abort of the command file will require some thought about
       clean-up before starting over.  This depends on where the  abort  occurs.
       In general, the installation procedure has a modular structure (described
       in  the  next  section)  so  it  is  not difficult to recover.  It is not
       usually necessary to start completely over.
       Basically there are three types of questions that will be  asked  by  the
       command files.  The first type is "Yes/No" where the answer is "Y" or "N"
       (with "N" being the default on a carriage return).

                  FPS100 PDP11 RSX-11M v 3.2 INSTALLATION NOTES        Page   11
       The second type has a string response with  no  default.   This  question
       displays  an  acceptable  range  for  the  number  of  characters  in the
       response, e.g.:
           GIVE FILE NAME  [S R:1-10]:
       The range, enclosed in brackets, says that between 1  and  10  characters
       will be accepted as an answer.
       The third type is an integer value response  question  which  displays  a
       number base indicator and default value, e.g.:
           ENTER CSR LOCATION FOR APnn [O D:176000]:
       This indicates octal base with a default of 176000.
       Another command file technique used is the  "PAUSE".   This  is  used  to
       allow  in-line  correction  of  detected  problems  that  may  be  easily
       corrected in many cases.  If you forgot to include  a  required  utility,
       the  command file will notify you of the problem and give you a chance to
       correct it.  The message from the command file processor is:
           AT.-- PAUSING. TO CONTINUE TYPE "RES ...AT."
       which then accepts commands from the terminal.  When the required actions
       have been performed, type
           RES AT.
       to continue the command file where it left off.  If the  required  action
       cannot  be  performed  for  some  reason at that point, abort the command
       processor by typing
           ABO AT.
       and then correct the problem.  In general, this condition will not  occur
       if the System Setup was performed correctly.

     4.1.2 Structure of the Installation
       The installation command files are modularly structured so that  any  one
       of  them  may  be  executed  separately.  This allows a number of partial
       installation possibilities and error recovery options.
       The command  files  are  listed  at  the  end   of   these   installation
       instructions,  Section  IX.  Each command file has a header which defines
       the requirements for using that command file.
       A special command file called FIRST.CMD must be executed  before  any  of
       the  others.   It  collects  the information needed for the other command
       files and creates a parameter file called SETUP.CMD.
       The command files are arranged in a three level structure:
           master level
           product level
           program level
       MASTER.CMD is  the  "master"  command  file  that  controls  a   complete
       installation from start to finish.  Its sole function is to invoke all of
       the other command files in succession.
       The "product"  level  command  files  are  responsible  for  reading  the
       distribution  tape,  installing  the products, and deleting source files.
       They invoke the  lowest  level  "program"  command  files  to  build  the
       software.   Therefore, the "product" command files may be used to install
       software sub-groups such as PDS, LIB100, APLIB, MATHLIB, the  AP  Driver,
       FPS100 Supervisors, or Diagnostics.
       The "program" level command files are used to install  separate  programs
       such  as ASM100, FFT100, etc.  They do not read the tape or delete source
       files, and may be run separately to reinstall any programs that  did  not
       install correctly or require unforseen modifications.

       A table of the structure in execution order follows:
       FIRST.CMD      Run only once to define parameters
                      and create SETUP.CMD
       MASTER.CMD     To install all of the software

                      cannot be executed separately

       DGN100.CMD *     TST10.CMD         installs TST100
                        PTH10.CMD         installs PTH100
                        ART10.CMD         installs ART100
                        FFT10.CMD         installs FFT100
                        MEM10.CMD         installs MEM100
                        UFT10.CMD         installs UFT100
       APL100.CMD *     no subfiles       installs APLIB (Math Lib)
       PDSTST.CMD *     no subfiles       installs PDS Tests
       SUP100.CMD *     no subfiles       installs Supervisors
       CLEAN.CMD        no subfiles       cleans up disk
        * Indicates tape reading is done in this command file.
          To disable this when running partial installations, edit
          the desired command file and locate the line containing
          "@TREAD". Insert a semicolon ahead of this line, making it
          read ";@TREAD", and the pass to be read from the tape will
          be skipped when the command file is executed.
       The order of doing partial installations is  crucial;   certain  previous
       steps  must  be  completed  before  installing a particular portion.  The
       requirements for running each command file are given  in  the  header  of
       each file (see Section IX).

       Notice in the above table that HSR100.CMD and LIB100.CMD do not read  the
       tape.   Because  of  this,  the option to delete source files is given if
       they are invoked directly (not by MASTER.CMD).  This is  helpful  if  you
       have  difficulties  installing  these  portions  and  the process must be
       repeated.  Driver sources are deleted at the very end by CLEAN.CMD.
       Generally speaking, if the  sources  are  already  on  disk,  it  is  not
       necessary  to read the tape.  The "program" level command files should be
       used to save time if the files are already on disk.

     4.1.3 Error Recovery
       Referring to the previous section, one can easily tell where to resume if
       an error occurs.   Also,  each  command  file  includes  a  header  which
       specifies the requirements for executing it (listings are in Section IX).
       Remember  that  the  required  previous  steps  must  be completed before
       continuing from some point.
       The first step in recovering from command file errors is to determine and
       correct the cause of the error.  Possible causes of errors include:
           I/O errors- Usually hardware.  Have the disk and tape drives checked.
               The disk packs themselves may be faulty.
           Workfile errors- Usually means the system disk is full.  Clean it  up
               and make sure there is a comfortable margin of free space.
           Files Deleted errors- Determine which files are missing  and  restore
               them;  or be sure the files are in the correct UIC.
           File Allocation errors- This applies to  a  wide  variety  of  RSX11M
               error  messages,  but  usually  means  the  desired disk is full.
               Clean up unnecessary files to create extra disk space.
       The next step is to determine that all required files are present.  Refer
       to the command file headers for the list of required files.  See  Section
       VII.   on  MAGTAP  for  instructions  on  using  the  MAGTAP tape reading
       program.
       If errors occur in certain "program" sections when  doing  the  automatic
       installation,  it  is  safe  to  allow the installation to complete.  The
       "safe" sections are the PDS  and  Diagnostic  programs,  PDS  tests,  and
       Supervisors.  After correcting the problem, run the command files for the
       programs in error.
       If an error occurs in a "product" level command file, the best course  of
       action is to abort the command file, correct the problems, and proceed by
       rerunning the product level command file again.  Continue from this point
       by  running  the  remaining product level command files manually.  If the
       command file processor aborts by itself, the same  course  of  action  is
       applicable.   If  the  source  files are present, run the "program" level
       command files to avoid reading  the  tape  again,  or  disable  the  tape
       reading as described in the previous section.
       It is not possible to resume  execution  from  the  Master  command  file
       without  modifying  it  to  skip  the  already  finished  sections.  Such
       modification is not recommended for the RSX11M amateur.

       If you run the "program" level command files manually,  you  must  delete
       source  file  as  you  proceed.   This  is required because disk space is
       limited.  Map files created by the task builder (FILE.MAP) must  also  be
       deleted.   These  maps  are  useful  for  debug purposes and are normally
       deleted by the "product" level command file.

     4.1.4 Site Dependencies
       Probably by the time you are ready to run the command files you will know
       what disks you are using, the kind of mag tape unit, etc.  But as an  aid
       in  preparing  to do the installation, the following items of information
       are required:
       The mag tape handler mnemonic and unit number
       (e.g. "MM:" and "MM0:").
       The disk drive unit names for both the work disk and the system disk (may
       be the same if using a big disk) (e.g.  "DK0:"  and "DK1:").
       The FPS tape density and blocking factor.
       Which products are to be installed.
       Which vector and CSR location to use for the AP driver.  These  must  not
       be  in  conflict  with  the user's devices and should be checked with the
       site manager (170 and 176000 are recommended).
       It is important to have  a  hard  copy  terminal  if  possible.   If  not
       available,  a  CRT  terminal  must be monitored at all times since errors
       affecting the integrity of the software could occur.
       It is necessary to use a privileged terminal for this installation.   The
       system console on a multi-user system may be used.
       It is not necessary to inform the command files which utilities are being
       used, but it must be specified during system setup whether  F4P  or  FOR,
       MAC  or  BIGMAC, and TKB or BIGTKB will be used.  The unused and unwanted
       compilers, assemblers, and utilities should be deleted  from  the  system
       disk  to  prevent  accidental  and unexpected use.  The alternative is to
       "install" only the desired utilities when starting the  system.   If  the
       desired utility is the only one installed, that one will be used.  In the
       case of F4P and FOR, errors will result if both are installed.

   4.2  Patch Implementation
+       ____________________
     The  file  PATCH.DAT  is read in along with the command files.  It contains
     installation fixes to be applied directly to the software and documentation
     of identified problems.  The fixes specified in  the  PATCH  file  must  be
     applied prior to starting the command files.
     The following procedure may be used:
     1.  Using MAGTAP, manually read the files to be patched.
     2.  Use the text editor to apply the changes.
     3.  Delete the old versions of the files.
     MAGTAP always creates version 1 files.  Regardless of what  is  present  on
     the  disk, ASM100.FTN will always be read in as ASM100.FTN;1 (e.g.  version
     1).  When the file is modified using  the  editor,  it  receives  a  higher
     version  number.   When  the command file reads the tape, that file will be
     version 1 always.  But the compilers and assemblers use the higher numbered
     versions which are the patched files.  Furthermore, the command files  only
     delete the version 1 files so the patched files are not lost.
     Since disk space is critical, if numerous large files must  be  patched,  a
     partial  (rather  than  complete) installation must be performed.  If it is
     desired to save the patched sources, they should be transferred to  another
     disk  before disk space on the work disk runs out.  If space is no problem,
     the patched sources may be deleted after the tasks are all built.
     Note that when patches are made,  and  the  command  files  try  to  delete
     version  1  files  that have already been deleted, a PIP error message will
     appear during command file execution.  This type of error  message  may  be
     ignored, and does not affect the correctness of the installation.

   4.3  Complete Installation
+       _____________________
     To  initiate  the  automatic  installation,  the  following  steps  must be
     performed:
     The system must be booted and the  work  disk  mounted.   Set  the  UIC  to
     [100,100], assign SY:  to the work disk (ASN dev:=SY:), and start the Setup
     command file by typing:
         @FIRST
     The command file asks questions which must be answered in  accordance  with
     this  particular  installation  (see  Site  Dependencies  in  the  previous
     section).  When the Setup session is completed, the file SETUP.CMD will  be
     present.   Do  not  delete  this file since it is used by the other command
     files.
     Start the automatic procedure by typing:
         @MASTER
     The command files will ask for the vector and CSR locations for use by  the
     AP driver.  The installation then proceeds to completion.
     The only operator intervention required is to mount tapes if  the  software
     exists on multiple tapes.  The tape reading command files were specified in
     the  earlier  section  "Structure of the Installation".  If a tape mount is
     required, the MAGTAP program pauses while the tape is being  mounted.   The
     option  to  terminate  should  be answered negatively and a carriage return
     signals that the next tape is ready.  After the tape reading is  completed,
     remount  the  first  FPS  tape  in  preparation  for  the next tape reading
     operation.
     If all the software installs correctly, proceed  to  Section  E.,  and  run
     APLIB  through  LED100.   Then  proceed  to  the tests.  In case of errors,
     consult the section on Error Recovery.
     An automatic installation may be restarted from the beginning but you  must
     first  delete  any extra files in order to provide the required disk space.
     The automatic installation cannot be continued from a certain point without
     modifying the MASTER.CMD file.  As previously mentioned, modifying  command
     files is dangerous unless you are familiar with the RSX11M indirect command
     file processor.

   4.4  Partial Installation
+       ____________________
     The  preliminary  steps  for  a  partial installation are the same as for a
     complete automatic installation.  The file SETUP.CMD  must  be  created  as
     described above.
     A partial installation is invoked by typing:
         @FILENAME
     where FILENAME specifies a "product" or "program" level command file to  be
     executed.   The  names  and software installed are specified in the section
     "Structure of the Installation".  Partial installations must be done in the
     order shown in the table since  subsequent  portions  use  the  results  of
     earlier  portions.   For  example, LIB100 must be completed before building
     any PDS or Diagnostic tasks.
     The only other consideration is whether you need to  manually  read  source
     files  from  the  tape and whether you need to delete them (and .MAP files)
     after a section is completed.  If you are running from the "product" level,
     the tape reading and disk clean-up is done automatically.  If running  from
     the  "program"  level,  the  source files must be present when required and
     files must be deleted to provide space on the disk.
     The exceptions to this rule are HSR100.CMD and LIB100.CMD which do not read
     from the tape.  They require Pass 1 files which are read during  DRV100.CMD
     execution  (another  reason  why  the  order  of  execution  is important).
     Because of this and the fact that partial installations  may  be  repeated,
     the  option  to  delete  source  files  is  given at the end.  If a problem
     occurred, answer "N" and try again after correcting the problem.
     Multiple tapes require the same procedure as  described  for  the  complete
     automatic installation.
     When all the software has installed correctly, proceed to the next  section
     and run APLIB through LED100.  Then go on to the tests.

   4.5  Running APLIB Through the Library Editor
+       ________________________________________
     Before  performing  this operation, make sure that enough disk space exists
     on the  work  disk.    (Do   "PIP   /FR"   for   free   space,   and   "PIP
     LB:[1,1]APLIB.*/LI" for the library size.)
     If there is not enough, you will need to dismount the current work disk and
     use a scratch disk, making sure that the LED100 task is  available  to  run
     (transfer it to the system disk if there is room).  You will need 1.2*(size
     of APLIB) blocks of free space on the work disk, and 0.2*(size of APLIB) on
     the system disk.
     The procedure is to have LED100 read APLIB from the system disk  and  write
     the  edited  APLIB  to the work disk.  Then tell PIP to copy it back to the
     system disk, superseding the original version:
          *** If you have enough space:
          SET /UIC=[1,1]

     Note to installer:
     This section may be skipped  unless  the  customer  wishes  to  change  the
     "configuration" as described below.
     The following files  are  related  to  the  MTS100  supervisor.   The  disk
     containing those files should be mounted in a work drive.
     Assign disk names:
           ASN DK0:=LB:     (Assuming two RK05 drives)
           ASN DK1:=SY:
     source files  insert files   object files   command files

     UPEX.S                       UPEX.B
     The "source" files and "insert" files are  normally  not  required  by  the
     user.  They are used only if the user wishes to change the configuration as
     described below.
     The "object" files and "command" files must be located  on  the  SY:   disk
     when the customer runs LOD100 to create a Supervisor load module.
     The command file LODSYS.INP is used by LOD100 to automate the creation of a
     Super-100 load module.  The user builds a load module for each application.
     The load module contains both the User tasks and  the  Super-100  routines.
     The  Super-100  routines are provided in object form for use by LOD100;  it
     is not necessary to assemble  the  source  files  if  the  standard  system
     defaults  are  used.   The insert files are used when assembling the source
     code.
     The TABLES file contains the  two  "block  data"  equivalents,  SYSCOM  and
     CONFIG, referred to below.

     The SYSGEN procedure consists of checking and possibly modifying two system
     data areas, namely the commons SYSCOM and CONFIG.
     SYSCOM defines the size of the system save area.  This area should be large
     enough to handle interrupts from all possible sources.  These include:
             3 internal synchonous
             1 spurious
             2 host
             1 RTC
             1 spurious I/O
+           ___
             8    plus 1 or 2 for each I/O device
                          (e.g. 2 for IOP, 1 for GPIOP)
     The system is delivered with a default of 10  interrupt  save  blocks.   If
     this  is  not  large enough, then the file COMSYS.DAT should be modified as
     follows:  (for 'n' possible interrupt sources)
             Change the line
                     SYSIZE = MNSIZE * 10.
             to
                     SYSIZE = MNSIZE * n.
     Then reassemble all files using COMSYS as a $INSERT file.
     CONFIG is the configuration table for  I/O  devices.   Each  I/O  interrupt
     corresponds  to  a  5-word entry in this table.  The user sets the relative
     priority of each device by setting the priority mask (first word)  of  each
     entry.   A  bit on means that interrupts from the corresponding device will
     be disabled during the interrupt servicing of  the  device  whose  priority
     mask it is.
     Examples:
         A device with the highest priority  should  have  all  bits  set,  i.e.
         priority mask = 177777 (octal).  This will mask out interrupts from all
         other devices while this device is being serviced.
         A device with the lowest priority should have only  its  own  bit  set.
         E.g.   the  device  corresponding to IMASK bit 1 should have a priority
         mask of 040000 (octal).
         If the device corresponding to bit 1  of  IMASK  is  supposed  to  have
         higher priority than only the device corresponding to IMASK bit 2, then
         DEV1's priority mask = 060000 (octal) and DEV2's priority mask = 020000
         (octal).
     The system is delivered with the minimum mask for each device,  i.e.   only
     its  own  bit  set.  If the user wishes to change it, the CONFIG portion of
     the TABLES.S file must be reassembled.

     Other than the above procedures, the system is "generated"  with  each  new
     load  module.   A command file (LODSYS.INP) is provided as input to LOD100,
     in order to load the supervisor kernel and service routines.   The  command
     file ends leaving the loader ready to receive ISR's and tasks.
     The following shows the contents (plus explanations) of LODSYS.INP:
     PS 7740            set initial PS address near top of 4K PS memory
     LOAD BOOTSP.B      load system initializer
     PS 0               set base PS address to 0
     MD 0               set base MD address to 0
     LOAD TABLES.B      load SYSCOM and CONFIG
     LOAD SYSSVC.B      load system services
     LOAD HSVC.B        load host communication routines
     LOAD ENABLE.B      load I/O device interrupt enable routine
     MARK               make all of the above stay in loader's tables
     LOAD KERNEL.B      load supervisor kernel
     LOAD RTC.B         load real time clock routines
     LINK               link all of the above
     MAP 0 SYSMAP       output load map to file "SYSMAP"
     MODE TASK          change loader mode to accept ISR's and tasks
     The user should invoke this file immediately following the OUT command in a
     LOD100 session, which should be the first command  to  the  loader.   After
     LODSYS.INP  terminates,  he  may  load the appropriate ISR's and his tasks.
     (He may want to make his own command file for that.)
     Some examples of creating Super-100 load modules can be found in the  FINAL
     TESTING  section  of  this document.  The following is an example of a load
     session in which the host ISR and one task is loaded.
     Example only;  it is not intended to actually run.
     R LOD100
     OUT hasifile lmfile /D       set up output files
     INPUT LODSYS.INP             get commands from LODSYS.INP
     LOAD HIRP.B                  load host ISR
     LINK                         link
     MAP 0 HIRP.MAP               send map to file "HIRP.MAP"
     TREE ((1))                   set up task overlay structure
     OV 1                         (same) (see loader manual)
     LOAD TASK1.B                 load task
     LINK                         link
     MAP 0 TASK1.MAP              send map to file "TASK1.MAP"
     EXIT                         exit from load session
     If the host machine has the facility to record  terminal  I/O  (similar  to
     Prime COMO files), then the user is advised to use it to document each load
     session.   He  can then replace all the "MAP 0 filename" commands with just
     "MAP", which will print a load map at the terminal (and  therefore  in  the
     record file), instead of having several map files.

     Note on Real Time Clock routines:
     For those users who need as much user PS space as they can get and  who  do
     not  require  software  support  of the real time clock as a system service
     (i.e.  don't use the timed-wait SVC's), the LODSYS.INP command file may  be
     altered as follows:
        Change        L RTC.B
        to            L NORTC.B
     This will load null routines to satisfy entry points, and will  reduce  the
     amount of PS space the system uses by about 190 words.

     LOD100;   it  is not necessary to assemble the source files if the standard
     system defaults are used.  The insert files are used  when  assembling  the
     source code.
     The MINI file contains the two "block data" equivalents, SYSCOM and CONFIG,
     referred to below.
     The SYSGEN procedure consists of checking and possibly modifying two system
     data areas, namely the commons SYSCOM and CONFIG.

     SYSCOM defines the size of the system save area.  This area should be large
     enough to handle interrupts from all possible sources.  These include:
             3 internal synchonous
             1 spurious
             2 host
             1 RTC
             1 spurious I/O
+           ___
             8    plus 1 or 2 for each I/O device
                          (e.g. 2 for IOP, 1 for GPIOP)
     The system is delivered with a default of 10  interrupt  save  blocks.   If
     this  is  not  large enough, then the file MINCOM.DAT should be modified as
     follows:  (for 'n' possible interrupt sources)
             Change the line
                     SYSIZE = MNSIZE * 10.
             to
                     SYSIZE = MNSIZE * n.
     Then reassemble all files  using  MINCOM  as  a  $INSERT  file.   (See  the
     LODMIN.INP command file for a list of files to reassemble.)
     CONFIG is the configuration table for  I/O  devices.   Each  I/O  interrupt
     corresponds  to  a  5-word entry in this table.  The user sets the relative
     priority of each device by setting the priority mask (first word)  of  each
     entry.   A  bit on means that interrupts from the corresponding device will
     be disabled during the interrupt servicing of  the  device  whose  priority
     mask it is.
     Examples:
         A device with the highest priority  should  have  all  bits  set,  i.e.
         priority mask = 177777 (octal).  This will mask out interrupts from all
         other devices while this device is being serviced.
         A device with the lowest priority should have only  its  own  bit  set.
         E.g.   the  device  corresponding to IMASK bit 1 should have a priority
         mask of 040000 (octal).
         If the device corresponding to bit 1  of  IMASK  is  supposed  to  have
         higher priority than only the device corresponding to IMASK bit 2, then
         DEV1's priority mask = 060000 (octal) and DEV2's priority mask = 020000
         (octal).
     The system is delivered with the minimum mask for each device,  i.e.   only
     its  own  bit  set.  If the user wishes to change it, the CONFIG portion of
     the MINI.S file must be reassembled.

     Other than the above procedures, the system is "generated"  with  each  new
     load  module.   A command file (LODMIN.INP) is provided as input to LOD100,
     in order to load the supervisor kernel and service routines.   The  command
     file  ends leaving the loader ready to receive ISR's and the UPEX task with
     user routines.
     The following shows the contents (plus explanations) of LODMIN.INP:
     MD 0               set base MD address to 0
     PS 1740            set initial PS address near top of 1K PS memory
     LOAD BOOTMN.B      load system initializer
     PS 0               set base PS address to 0
     LOAD MINI.B        load supervisor kernel
     LOAD HSVCM.B       load host communication routines
     MARK               make all of the above stay in loader's tables
     LINK               link all of the above
     MAP 0 MINMAP       output load map to file "MINMAP"
     MODE TASK          change loader mode to accept ISR's and tasks
     The user should invoke this file immediately following the OUT command in a
     LOD100 session, which should be the first command  to  the  loader.   After
     LODMIN.INP  terminates, he may load the appropriate ISR's and his routines.
     (He may want to make his own command file for that.)
     Some examples of creating Mini-100 load modules can be found in  the  FINAL
     TESTING  section  of  this document.  The following is an example of a load
     session in which the host ISR and one user routine is loaded.
     Example only;  it is not intended to actually run.
     R LOD100
     OUT hasifile lmfile /D       set up output files
     INPUT LODMIN.INP             get commands from LODMIN.INP
     LOAD HIRPM.B                 load host ISR
     LINK                         link
     MAP 0 HIRPM.MAP              send map to file "HIRPM.MAP"
     TREE ((1))                   set up task overlay structure
     OV 1                         (same) (see loader manual)
     LOAD UPEXM.B                 load the single task
     CALL SUBR1 /                 make HASI for SUBR1
     LOAD SUBR1.B                 load user routine
     LINK                         link
     MAP 0 SUBR1.MAP              send map to file "SUBR1.MAP"
     EXIT                         exit from load session
     If the host machine has the facility to record  terminal  I/O  (similar  to
     Prime COMO files), then the user is advised to use it to document each load
     session.   He  can then replace all the "MAP 0 filename" commands with just
     "MAP", which will print a load map at the terminal (and  therefore  in  the
     record file), instead of having several map files.

     Note on Real Time Clock support:
     For those users who habitually will use the Real Time Clock as an available
     device, the LODMIN.INP command file should be altered  to  include  loading
     the  files  RTCREQ.B  and IOQUE.B with the rest of the permanently resident
     kernel, and the clock's ISR (RTCISR.B) should be loaded with  other  ISR's.
     If MINCOM was altered as explained for the SYSGEN, then  the  source  files
     RTCREQ.S, IOQUE.S, and RTCISR.S should also be re-assembled.
     For a sample load session, see the command file for the Mini-100 Supervisor

       There are six files on the tape  involved  with  global  testing  of  the
       software.  These files are:
       GLBTST.FTN - FORTRAN mainline for the tests.
       PDSTST.VFC - VFC subroutine for the tests.
       SEQV1.S    - Assembler source for one of the tests.
       SEQV1.DAT  - Insert file for SEQV1.S.
       SEQV2.S    - Assembler source for one of the tests.
       LODTST.DAT - Command file for LOD100.
       The purpose of these tests is to verify that the software  products  have
       been  interfaced  properly  to the system and to each other.  These tests
       will check a typical path through the software products in a  manner  not
       unlike the way a user would develop his application.

+               _________________________________
         This test creates a program which will be  run  in  the  FPS-100.   The
         program  creates  a  vector  of  integers  from 1 to 32 and a vector of
         floating point values from 2.0 to 64.0  with  a  step  of  2.0  between
         elements.
         This test will produce some object code that  will  be  used  in  later
         tests.   The  following test will check the VFC100, ASM100, LOD100, and
         DBG100 interfaces to see if a program can be built and  executed.   You
         will need the Math Library LB:APLIB.LIB to run this test.
         First build PDSTST.B.
         RUN VFC100
         (source file =)  PDSTST.VFC
         (object file =)  PDSTST.S
         Now you must assemble PDSTST.S to get PDSTST.B.
         RUN ASM100
         (source file =)  PDSTST.S
         (object file =)  PDSTST.B
         (listing file =) PDSTST.LST
         (listing y/n)    Y
         (listing radix)  8
         You also need to create SEQV1.B.  To do this run ASM100.
         RUN ASM100
         (source file =)  SEQV1.S
         (object file =)  SEQV1.B
         (listing file =) SEQV1.LST
         (listing y/n)    Y
         (listing radix)  8
         Be sure to print a copy of PDSTST.LST for use later in this test.   Now
         that   you  have  created  SEQV1.B  and  PDSTST.B  you  can  create   a
         load-module.  To build a load-module, run LOD100.
         RUN LOD100
         *  OUT PDSTST.FTN LOADM.LM /D
         *  INPUT LODTST.DAT
             The following commands are in the command file LODTST.DAT.
               MDOFF 100             Set MD offset to 100 octal.
               CALL PDSTST           Generate a HASI called PDSTST.
               LOAD PDSTST.B         Load VFC part
               LOAD SEQV1.B          Load ASM100 subroutine part.

         Print the MAP files if desired.  You can now take your load-module  and
         run  it  in  DBG100.   The  purpose  of this DBG100 test is to see if a
         LOD100 load-module can be loaded into the AP and then  run.   The  test
         starts out by loading the load-module created above.

         Explanation:
         The G command places the load-module in the  FPS100.   Location  PS  25
         should  have  the  same  value  as  location  5  in the printed copy of
         PDSTST.LST.  Additional PS locations may be compared if desired.
         MD location 100 (octal) should have a value close to  1.00.   The  next
         location  should have a value close to 2.00.  The value in location 102
         (octal) of MD is a triple.  The F 0 command changes the display format.
         Now the value should be 001 001 001.
         The series of commands starting at E SP 0 will set the values 200, 300,
         and 400 in S-pads 0, 1, and 2.  These values are used  in  the  program
         execution following.
         The program is executed by setting the PS offset to  20  (octal)  using
         the O 20 command.  Then N 16 changes the radix to Hex.  A breakpoint is
         placed in PS at 40 Hex and the program is started by the R command.
         When PDSTST halts,  (hits  breakpoint),  it  should  have  generated  a
         vector.   At  location  103  (octal),  of  MD, the vector will have the
         integers 1 through 32 in ascending order.
         The series of commands including W and Y are designed to test the  file
         writing and yanking mechanism.
         This is the end of the VFC100>ASM100>LOD100>DGB100 global test.

         This test will check the ASM100, LNK100, and SIM100 interfaces  to  see
         if a program can be built and executed.

         Print a copy of SEQV2.LST for later use.  Now take SEQV2.B and create a
         linked file called SEQV2.DAT.  The * indicates the prompt displayed  by

         Explanation:
         After loading the program, the examine function verifies that the  file
         was  loaded  correctly.   Examine  PS location 0.  This should have the
         same value in it as location 0 in SEQV2.LST.

         The next part of the test sets a breakpoint in PS memory at location 5.
         The R command starts the program running at 0 and it runs until address
         5 is reached.  When SEQV2 halts,  (hits  breakpoint),  it  should  have
         generated  a  vector  at  location  0 in MD.  This vector will have the
         integer values 1 through 32 in ascending order.  The F command  changes
         the display format for integers and the E command displays the value at
         MD 0 which should be 1.  The next value should be 2.
         The W command prints a sequence of values  on  the  line  printer.   If
         there  is  no printer, use TI:  for output to the terminal.  The values
         should be integers in ascending order from 1 to 32.
         The G command loads the previously created load module that was created
         by LOD100.  PS location 25 should have the same value as location 5  in
         the printout of PDSTST.LST.  Additional PS locations can be compared to
         verify the correct contents.  MD location 100 should have a value close
         to  1.00  while  location  101 has about 2.00.  Location 102 contains a
         triple with the value 001 001 001.
         The series of commands including W and Y are designed to test the  file
         writing and yanking mechanism.
         This is the end of the ASM100>LNK100>SIM100 global test.

         The files required for this test include the Super-100 files  mentioned
         earlier and the following additional files:
               MAKE22.INP
               ECHO.B
               RUN2X.FTN
         The Super-100 Load Module is created as follows:
               RUN LOD100
               * OUT  TEST22.FTN  TEST22.LM  /D
               * INPUT  LODSYS.INP
               * INPUT  MAKE22.INP
               FOR RUN2X=RUN2X
               FOR TEST22=TEST22
               TKB
               RUN2X=RUN2X,TEST22,LB:[1,1]LIB100/LB

               //
               @LB:[1,2]UPAP
               RUN RUN2X
         The program will ask if you want terminal or printer output.  There  is
         then a delay while the Load Module is transferred to the FPS-100.  When
         the  Run light goes on steady, the test is running.  A stream of output
         should appear;  if not, there is an interface problem.
         The output includes several 2 line blocks that have the following form:
          # 22   SWR 123456 RUNFG 123456    FN 123456  CTRL 123456  LITES 123456
          # 22 SUPVR 123456
         The first number on each line (22) is just an identifying  number  used
         for locating the program line that generated this block.  The remainder
         of the data shows the values of various registers, flags, and counters.
         These values are used mainly for debug purposes.
           SWR      Switch register value on last call to AP.
           RUNFG    The Run flag value.  Normally zero.
           FN       Function register value.
           CTRL     Control register value.
           LITES    Lites register value on last interrupt from AP.
           SUPVR    Supervisor flag.  0 = No Supervisor.
                                      1 = MTS100 running in the AP.
                                     -1 = RTS100 running in the AP.

         A number of lines with the following form will appear:
               HPUT.  DEST =  5    DATUM =  1234
         These lines show the values being sent  to  the  FPS-100.   The  number
         following DEST is in the range 1 to 7 and indicates which of the 7 full
         duplex  ports  is  being used.  The number following DATUM is the value
         being sent to the FPS-100.
         Some lines with the following form also appear:
             HTST      5      0      16      LITES= 133
         This shows values received from the FPS-100.  The first number  on  the
         line  is  the  port  number  in the range 1 to 7 on which the value was
         received.  The second number is a flag:
             0  means a value was received, FPS-100 running.
            -1  means no value received, FPS-100 running.
             1  means no value received, FPS-100 is halted.
             2  means a value was received, FPS-100 is halted.
         The third number is the datum value received.  It should correspond  to
         a  value  previously  sent  (HPUT) to the same port number.  The number
         following LITES is the most recent value from the LITES register.
         The last few lines of output should include:

               RUN RUN6X
         The program will ask if you want terminal or printer output.
         T ram will ask if you want terminal or printer output.
         enThere is then a delay while the Load Module  is  transferred  to  the
         FPS-100.  When the Run light goes on steady, the test is running.
         The comment "START TIMING" appears on  the  terminal  and  the  program
         calls  an  FPS100  subroutine 20000 times.  Each call includes some DMA
         transfers and some APWD calls.  The execution time is about 5.0 to  5.5
         minutes.   Finally,  the  comment  "END  TIMING"  will  appear and some
         additional values are then printed.
         The program contains a DMA address which is supposed to be the same  as
         an  address  in  the  HASI  file.   The program prints this address for
         comparison.  This address is found in the  file  TEST63.FTN  (the  HASI
         file).   Find  SUBR1  and  look for APPUT or APGET.  The address is the
         second parameter in the call.  If the address does not match,  it  will
         be  neccesary  to  change  the value for KADD in the file RUN6X.FTN and
         then do the FORTRAN and TKB steps again.

+               _____________________________
         The files required for this test include the Super-100 files  mentioned
         earlier and the following additional files:
               MAKE51.INP
               TASK51.B
               TASK52.B
               TASK53.B
               RUN5X.FTN
         The Load Module for this test is created as follows:
               RUN LOD100
               * OUT  TEST51.FTN  TEST51.LM  /D
               * INPUT  LODSYS.INP
               * INPUT  MAKE51.INP
               FOR RUN5X=RUN5X
               FOR TEST51=TEST51

               UNITS=15
               //
               @LB:[1,2]UPAP
               RUN RUN5X
         The program will ask if you want terminal or printer output.  There  is
         then a delay while the Load Module is transferred to the FPS-100.  When
         the  Run light goes on steady, the test is running.  A stream of output
         should appear;  if not, there is an interface problem.
         This test runs 3  tasks  that  wait  for  differing  periods  of  time,
         increment a counter, and send the count value to the host.  Task 1 uses
         port  1,  task 2 uses port 2, and task 3 uses port 3.  In the meantime,
         the host program just loops for 99 times and requests values from the 3
         ports.
         The output includes a series of HTST lines as described above.  If  the
         second  number  is -1, it means that the corresponding task has not yet
         timed out since the last value was read from that port.
             If the second number is -1, ignore this line.
             If the second number is  0, the third number is valid.
         The final values should have a particular  ratio.   The  task  1  count
         should be double the task 3 count while task 2 falls between (about 1.3
         times task 3).

         The results of this test may differ on  successive  runs  since  it  is
         highly  dependent on the host machine activity and interrupt servicing.
         The FPS-100 tasks run at their own speed and are  not  synchronized  to
         the  host.   For  example, the terminal output differs greatly from the
         printer output since the different output devices have  much  different
         timings.  On the printer, a jump in the counts is noticed when the host
         services a print buffer.  On the terminal, the results are more uniform
         since the output is not collected in a buffer.

         The Mini-100 Load Module is created as follows:
             Time required is about 5 minutes.
               RUN LOD100
               * OUT  TEST1.HSI  TEST1.LM  /D

               //
               @LB:[1,2]UPAP
               RUN RUN1
         The program runs two subroutines on the FPS-100.  The results  must  be
         checked  with  the debugger (DBG100).  First, verify the PS location of
         the subroutines by looking at the final  map  from  LOD100:   the  file
         TEST1.MP2.  There should be a column which looks like:
               PSADDR
                 613
                 614
                 614
         The  numbers  in this column may vary slightly.  One of the subroutines
         uses a PS memory location to record the number of times it was  called.
         The  address  of  this  location  is 4 more than the last number in the
         above column (620 octal in this case).  The other subroutine leaves its
         parameters and their sum in MD locations 17701-17703 (octal).  Run  the
         debugger as follows:
         RUN DBG100
         1
         F 0
         W MD 17701 17703 TI:

         the  Run light goes on steady, the test is running.  A stream of output
         should appear;  if not, there is an interface problem.
         The output includes several 2 line blocks that have the following form:

         for locating the program line that generated this block.  The remainder
         of the data shows the values of various registers, flags, and counters.
         These values are used mainly for debug purposes.

         following DEST is in the range 1 to 7 and indicates which of the 7 full
         duplex  ports  is  being used.  The number following DATUM is the value
         being sent to the FPS-100.

         This shows values received from the FPS-100.  The first number  on  the
         line  is  the  port  number  in the range 1 to 7 on which the value was
         received.  The second number is a flag:
             0  means a value was received, FPS-100 running.
            -1  means no value received, FPS-100 running.
             1  means no value received, FPS-100 is halted.
             2  means a value was received, FPS-100 is halted.
         The third number is the datum value received.  It should correspond  to
         a  value  previously  sent  (HPUT) to the same port number.  The number
         following LITES is the most recent value from the LITES register.

         FPS-100.  When the Run light goes on steady, the test is running.
         The comment "START TIMING" appears on  the  terminal  and  the  program

         transfers and some APWD calls.  The execution time is about 5.0 to  5.5
         minutes.   Finally,  the  comment  "END  TIMING"  will  appear and some
         additional values are then printed.
         The program contains a DMA address which is supposed to be the same  as
         an  address  in  the  HASI  file.   The program prints this address for
         comparison.  This address is found in  the  file  TEST6.HSI  (the  HASI
         file).   Find  SUBR1  and  look for APPUT or APGET.  The address is the
         second parameter in the call.  If the address does not match,  it  will
         be neccesary to change the value for KADD in the file RUN6.FTN and then
         do the FORTRAN and TKB steps again.

         the  Run light goes on steady, the test is running.  A stream of output
         should appear;  if not, there is an interface problem.
         This test runs 3 timeout requests that wait for  differing  periods  of
         time,  increment  a  counter,  and  send  the  count value to the host.
         Timeout request 1 uses port 1, timeout  request  2  uses  port  2,  and
         timeout  request  3  uses  port  3.  The timeout requests run serially.
         After a timeout request's period has elapsed, the next one in the queue
         starts.  In the meantime, the host program just loops for 99 times  and
         tests for values from the 3 ports.
         The output includes a series of HTST lines as described above.  If  the
         second  number  is  -1, it means that the corresponding request has not
         yet timed out since the last value was read from that port.
             If the second number is -1, ignore this line.
             If the second number is  0, the third number is valid.

         The results of this test may differ on  successive  runs  since  it  is
         highly  dependent on the host machine activity and interrupt servicing.
         The FPS-100 tasks run at their own speed and are  not  synchronized  to
         the  host.   For  example, the terminal output differs greatly from the
         printer output since the different output devices have  much  different
         timings.  On the printer, a jump in the counts is noticed when the host
         services a print buffer.  On the terminal, the results are more uniform
         since the output is not collected in a buffer.

 7  MAGTAP
+   ______
   7.1  INTRODUCTION
+       ____________
     The purpose of this program is to facilitate the transfer of FPS files from
     the distribution tape to the host computer on-line storage.  It is designed
     for use in three modes.  The first is the command line mode where the  task
     may  be  installed  and invoked totally from a command line.  The second is
     the semi-automatic mode where dialogue is performed with the operator.  The
     Third mode is the manual mode.
   7.2  COMMAND LINE MODE
+       _________________
     The command line mode of operation  is  fully  automatic  and  requires  no
     operator  action  once  the  command  line  has  been entered The following
     sequence is used to install and execute the program.
     LOA MM:  (or MT:)
     INS MAGTAP/TASK=...MAG
     MAG dev,pass,f,dens,nflag,name
     The magnetic tape handler must be loaded for use  of  the  MAGTAP  program.
     Then the task must be installed such that the system knows about it and can
     pass  control  to it when invoked.  The MAG command invokes the program and
     the arguments on the line are passed to the program.  The  "dev"  paramater
     is  either MMn:  or MTn:  depending on which type of magnetic tape drive is
     being used, where "n" is the unit number of the drive, limited to a  single
     integer  digit.   The  "pass" parameter is the two (2) digit pass number of
     files to be retrieved from the tape.  The "f" parameter is a flag the value
     of which is either "Y" or "N".  "Y" should be used if the  user  wants  the
     program  to  delete all comment lines from FORTRAN files and "N" otherwise.
     The "dens" parameter is "0" for 800 BPI and "1" for 1600 BPI.  The  "nflag"
     and "name" parameters are optional.  The "nflag" is an "N" for retrieving a
     file  from  the tape by name and the "name" is the complete file name as it
     appears in the names file on the tape.  NOTE:  The format for  the  command
     line  input  is  fixed  and  must  be  entered as noted with "," separating
     parameters.  The program then reads  the  names  file  from  the  tape  and
     transfers  all  files  with  the  specified pass number to the SY:  logical
     unit, under the current UIC.

   7.3  SEMI-AUTOMATIC MODE
+       ___________________
     The semi-automatic mode is very much like the automatic  mode,  except  the
     program gets the required information from a dialogue with the user instead
     of from the command line.  The semi-automatic mode is invoked with:
     LOA MM: (or MT:)
     RUN MAGTAP(or "MAG" , if the program has already been installed
                with /TASK=...MAG)
     The program will then announce itself and ask "IS MAG TAPE HANDLER LOADED".
     An "N" answer will result in program termination for the user to  load  the
     proper handler.  A "Y" response causes the program to proceed by asking the
     following questions with the user supplying the proper responses.
      ENTER MAGTAPE DEVICE NAME (E.G. MT0:):
      ENTER TAPE DENSITY 0=800 BPI, 1=1600 BPI:
      IS THIS THE FIRST FPS TAPE (Y OR N):
     A "Y" answer causes the names file to be read from the tape.
      AUTO(0) OR MANUAL(1) MODE:
     A "0" answer will allow the user to read files by pass numbers or by  name.
      PASS NO.(0) OR NAME (1) MODE:
     A "1" will put the magtape program into the extract by name mode and a  "0"
     will receive:
      ENTER PASS NUMBER:
     The user then enters a two (2) digit pass number.  The next prompting  line
     will be:
      DELETE FORTRAN COMMENTS (Y OR N):
     The program will then read the files which are  contained  in  the  entered
     pass  number  to  the  SY:  disk under the current UIC, rewind the tape and
     exit.
     If names mode were selected, the following prompt would be issued:
      ENTER FILE NAME:
     The user then enters the filename to be read from the  tape.   The  "DELETE
     FORTRAN COMMENTS (Y OR N):"  will be displayed, and must be answered.  Then
     the  program will search for the specified file and copy it to disk.  Since
     rewinds are not performed in this mode, names must be entered in the  order
     they  appear on the tape.  The user can extract files by name one at a time
     until finished.  To terminate names mode, enter a carriage  return  at  the

     "ENTER FILENAME:"  level.
   7.4  MANUAL MODE
+       ___________
     The manual mode allows full control over what files are read and the  names
     the files are given.  This mode is invoked with:
     LOA MM:  (or MT:)
     RUN MAGTAP  (or "MAG", if the program has already been installed
                  with /TASK=...MAG)
     The program will then announce itself and ask "IS MAG TAPE HANDLER LOADED".
     An "N" answer will result in program termination for the user to  load  the
     proper handler.  A "Y" response causes the program to proceed by asking the
     following questions with the user supplying the proper responses.
      ENTER MAGTAPE DEVICE NAME (E.G. MT0:):
      ENTER TAPE DENSITY 0=800 BPI, 1=1600 BPI:
      IS THIS THE FIRST FPS TAPE (Y OR N):
     A "Y" answer causes the names file to be read from the tape.   "N"  may  be
     appropriate  to  use if the names file is not on the current tape, or if it
     is not going to be used.  A "Y" response causes the following:
      AUTO(0) OR MANUAL(1) MODE:
     A "1" answer puts MAGTAP into manual mode.  If "N" were the reponse to  the
     previous  question,  the automatic mode would be overridden and manual mode
     is forced.  MAGTAP will now prompt with:
      n filename :
     When the names file is being used or with:
      n COMMAND OR FILENAME :
     When the names file is not being used.  The user then can respond with  one
     of the following.
      CARRIAGE RETURN   (only when the names file was read in; causes
                         the displayed filename to be used to copy the
                         current file to disk)
      filename.ext   (the typed in filename will be used to copy the
                      current file to disk)
      $R  (the tape will be rewound)

      $F  (causes a shift to "file skip" mode. A further question
           will be asked to identify how many files to skip (if no
           names file was read in), or which file to skip to (if a
           names file was read in). In the latter case, skipping to
           previous files is allowed, but if the names file mode is
           not being used the positioning is strictly forward)
      $D  (all FORTRAN comments except FPS title lines are deleted
           during the copying of a file. This is a flip flop and
           entering it again will cause verbatim copying. The use of
           this on non-FORTRAN files should be discouraged, as any line
           beginning with a "C" will be deleted)
      $Q  (causes program termination, leaving the tape position
           wherever the last action left it. If reinvoked in manual
           mode without reading the names file MAGTAP can pick up from
           where it left off, but note that the index number will start
           at 0, regardless of the actual tape position)

 8  CUSTOMER USAGE
+   ______________
   The APEX uses logical units 3 and 4 and  events  flags  22,  23  and  24  for
   communication  with  the  AP  driver,  and  these  may  not be used for other
   purposes in any APEX task.
   The user must specify the use of APDEV common when task building a task which
   uses the AP.  This is done with the following TKB  command  included  in  the
   "ENTER OPTIONS" section of input:
   COMMON=APDEV:RW
   A command file called UPAP.CMD has been placed on the system disk  under  UIC
   [1,2]  by  the  installation.   This  file when run from the indirect command
   processor with:
   @DK:[1,2]UPAP
   Will load the required device common and the AP driver.
   Note also that since one page (4K) is devoted to device common  in  any  APEX
   task,  the  maximum  size  possible  is  28K  (28672  words)  for  tasks that
   communicate with the FPS100.  This 4K reduction in available task  memory  is
   necessary  to  achieve high speed front panel I/O to the array processor, and
   may be overcome by use of RSX11M overlaying techniques (see the  RSX11M  Task
   Builder manual).
